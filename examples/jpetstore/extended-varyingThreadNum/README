In order to run the exmaple Test Plan "jmx/JPS-varyingThreadNum.jmx", 
JMeter needs to be called from this directory since 
pathes included in the Test Plan are given relative 
to this directory.

In order to call the Test Plan in non-GUI mode, call:
$ {PATH/TO/JMETER} -n -t jmx/JPS-varyingThreadNum.jmx
